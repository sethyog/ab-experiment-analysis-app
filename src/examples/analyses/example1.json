  "summary": "The A/B test shows statistically significant improvements in both conversion rate and average order value, with a slight (though not statistically significant) decrease in bounce rate. The treatment version outperformed the control across all key metrics, suggesting it provides a better user experience that leads to higher engagement and revenue potential.",
  "key_metrics": [
    {
      "metric_name": "Conversion Rate",
      "value": "0.15 vs 0.12 (25% increase)",
      "interpretation": "Statistically significant improvement (p=0.04) indicating the treatment version is more effective at converting users."
    },
    {
      "metric_name": "Average Order Value",
      "value": "$48.20 vs $45.50 (5.9% increase)",
      "interpretation": "Statistically significant improvement (p=0.03) showing users in the treatment group spend more per order."
    },
    {
      "metric_name": "Bounce Rate",
      "value": "0.32 vs 0.35 (8.6% decrease)",
      "interpretation": "Positive trend but not statistically significant (p=0.06). Suggests improved user engagement but requires more data for confirmation."
    }
  ],
  "statistical_significance": "Two metrics show statistical significance at p<0.05 (conversion rate p=0.04, average order value p=0.03)",
  "recommendations": [
    "Implement the treatment version as it shows significant improvements in both conversion rate and average order value",
    "Continue monitoring bounce rate to confirm the positive trend with more data",
    "Analyze user segments to identify which types of users benefit most from the treatment"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "Sample size may not be large enough to detect smaller effects",
    "The test doesn't account for potential seasonal variations",
    "Long-term effects on customer retention are not measured in this analysis"
