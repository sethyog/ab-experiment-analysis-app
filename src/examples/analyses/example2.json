  "summary": "This A/B test demonstrates a comprehensive improvement in the e-commerce funnel with the treatment version. All key metrics show positive changes, with four out of six metrics showing statistical significance (p<0.05). The treatment version not only improves conversion rate and average order value but also significantly enhances user engagement metrics like time on site and checkout completion rate. This suggests a better overall user experience that translates to improved business outcomes.",

    {
      "metric_name": "Conversion Rate",
      "value": "0.15 vs 0.12 (25% increase)",

  "recommendations": [
    "Implement the treatment version across all users as it shows significant improvements across the e-commerce funnel",
    "Prioritize further optimization of the checkout process as it shows the most significant improvement",
    "Investigate what specific elements of the treatment version led to increased time on site",
    "Consider additional tests to further improve add-to-cart rate which showed positive but not significant changes",
    "Perform cohort analysis to understand if the treatment performs differently across user segments"
  ],
  "limitations": [
    "The test duration may not account for day-of-week or seasonal variations",
    "The analysis doesn't include long-term metrics like customer lifetime value or retention",
    "The test doesn't isolate which specific changes in the treatment version caused the improvements",
    "Mobile and desktop users may respond differently to the changes but are analyzed together"
